  <p>I'm Silas Reinagel, a software engineer, project manager, and software mentor.</p>

  <p>As a <b>programmer</b>, I write mostly in C# and Java, and specialize in Microservice Architecture, Distributed Computing, Messaging Patterns, Object-Oriented Design, and Automated Testing. I have been creating software solutions for over 15 years, and have worked in Manufacturing, Medical, Legal, eCommerce, Hospitality, Internet Privacy, and Crypto-Currency industries. </p>

  <p>As a <b>software mentor</b>, I have apprenticed two different engineers for over a year each, with hands-on instruction, intensive studies, and with a variety of team and individual projects. My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-reinagel-6577a2114/">first apprentice</a> is already making waves in the software industry and challenging his teams to engineer the best solutions and put their hearts into their work every day. </p>

  <p>As a <b>project manager</b>, I have organized teams to deliver a variety of software projects: video games, microservices, libraries, and desktop applications. In particular, I thrive at delivering highly resource constrained projects, such as rapid prototypes, game jams, and tightly scoped web services.</p>
